Weather forecast
----------------

API Key:

This plugin requires you to register for an API ley from weatherunderground.

   See: http://www.wunderground.com/weather/api

As the screen displays hourly data, you'll need a "Cumulus" or "Anvill" plan key. These should be free if you keep your requests low (and for this reason the screen should only poll once every hour).


Configuring locations:

There's a number of ways to set up locations. Have a look at the "query" section on this page:

  http://www.wunderground.com/weather/api/d/docs?d=data/index

Any of those formats can be entered into the "address" part of the config file.


Known issues:
-------------

- Images flashing
- Layout is a bit rubbish!
